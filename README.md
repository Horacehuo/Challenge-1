# Challenge-1

this repo contains a jupyter file which is the solution of challenge_1. the code is not hard but algorithm is little bit tricky since starting checking the first digit is much faster than checking the last one. i mainly used the fucntion like 1233//1000=1 to get the each digit and then check whether it is even or not.

i feel proud of the algorithm that i used and the way i created the function which would be easily changed by others in a team work
